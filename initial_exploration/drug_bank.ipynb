Both male and female rats given 10 mg/kg pralsetinib or more had observable degeneration within the testis/ovaries. In 28-day rat and monkey studies, once-daily pralsetinib resulted in histological necrosis at doses 1.1 or more times the recommended human dose and myocardial hemorrhage at doses 2.6 or more times the recommended human dose. Also, pralsetinib induced hyperphosphatemia (rats only, dose 2.4-3.5 times the recommended human dose) and multi-organ mineralization (dose 0.11 or more times the recommended human dose).[L15986]  \n",

       "2  Rearranged during transfection (RET) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase containing extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains whose activity is required for normal kidney and nervous system development.[A202061, A202055] Constitutive RET activation is achieved through chromosomal rearrangements producing 5' fusions of dimerizable domains to the 3' _RET_ tyrosine kinase domain leading to constitutive dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation; the most common fusions are _KIF5B-RET_ and _CCDC6-RET_, although more than 35 genes have been reported to fuse with _RET_.[A202055, A202049, A202073] Constitutive activation leads to increased downstream signalling and is associated with tumour invasion, migration, and proliferation.[A202046]\\r\\n\\r\\nPralsetinib (formerly referred to as BLU-667) was developed through screening more than 10,000 agnostically designed kinase inhibitors followed by extensive chemical modification to improve its properties. Pralsetinib displays _in vitro_ IC<sub>50</sub> values for both WT RET as well as several mutant forms, including CCDC6-RET, in the range of 0.3-0.4 nmol/L, and is 100-fold more selective for RET kinase over 96% of 371 kinases tested.[A219751] It is this specific inhibition of RET kinase that is associated with anti-tumour activity and clinical benefit in patients.[A219751, A219756, L15986]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite increased selectivity for RET over other kinases, pralsetinib has been reported to inhibit DDR1, TRKC, FLT3, JAK1-2, TRKA, VEGFR2, PDGFRb, and FGFR1-2 at clinically relevant concentrations. The significance of these findings remains uncertain.[L15986]  "
